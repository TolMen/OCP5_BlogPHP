# PHP Blog Project

> **Ce projet a été réalisé dans le cadre de mon apprentissage pour le parcours d'OpenClassrooms (Développeur d'application PHP/Symfony).**

This project is a blog developed in PHP, which allows a developer to present his talents and skills through a personalized blog.
The website is developed from scratch, without using WordPress, to showcase PHP web development skills.

## Features

- Home page with developer information (last name, first name, photo/logo, catchphrase).
- List of all blog posts, sorted from newest to oldest.
- Detailed view for each blog post, with title, content, date updated, and comment form.
- Addition, modification and deletion of articles, reserved for the blogger.
